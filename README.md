Hiring undergraduate students
Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)
The SURP program is organised and run by the SURP committee. It runs from the first week of May through the third week of August each year. In addition to pursuing research, undergraduate students in SURP attend various events that often include a first week computing course, seminars and workshops on various topics, and student presentations. 
Requests for potential summer project descriptions are sent by the committee, typically in late fall. 
Student applications are solicited through the SURP webpages, with an application deadline in late January or early February. Student application packages are shared with SURP supervisors, with selection and employment offers timelines in late February - early March. 
Funding requirements for the supervisor vary depending on student selection for NSERC awards, faculty position, etc. 
Work study
U of T runs a work study program to hire undergraduates over the Fall/Winter and Summer semesters. Students must be enrolled in courses over the work study period.  
Project descriptions are solicited in June for Fall/Winter semesters, and in Feb/March for Summer semesters. The application is open, so this program is not suited to hiring a specific student. 
Selected projects receive funding for 70% of the student pay, with the supervisor contributing the rest.

Stipend payments
Each September, you will get an offer letter from the graduate administrator that breaks down your funding sources and lists your final salary for the year
The grant money is paid in three instalments in September, January, and May, and you get TA salary payments at the end of each month you TA
Each instalment of your grant money may come in multiple separate pieces because the funding comes from different sources (the department, your supervisor, external scholarships, etc). These portions can arrive in your bank account weeks apart from each other!
Your TA money and supervisor funded portion of your stipend are paid through the employment system, while the portions that come from the department and A&S are paid through ACORN
Set up direct deposit in both systems to get your money more quickly. Gautam will reach out about setting up your employee portal, and you can enter direct deposit info in ACORN directly. 
Since you aren’t paid regularly, it’s helpful to write out a yearly budget. Use your yearly salary from your September offer letter and divide that by 12 to get your monthly income, and use that to help you stick to a budget.
How much vacation time can I take?
3 weeks (15 working days) each academic year (September 1st - August 31st). This refreshes every year, does not accrue from year to year.
Scheduled holidays and winter break do not count towards these three weeks.
No formal way to set vacation dates, usually just inform your supervisor.

I need to book a room for a meeting/office hours, what do I do?
To book a room in AB (e.g. AB88), sign in to http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/internal/bookings-calendar/ and book from there (does any one know the password for this link?)
To book a general room/lecture hall on campus, use https://lsm.utoronto.ca/webapp/f?p=220

Who to contact: Andrew? I’m not really sure
Which scholarships can I apply to and when?
There are generally two major deadlines for domestic applicants a year for applying to funding, some smaller ones may pop up throughout the year as well
In september: NSERC and Vanier
In May: OGS (+ OGS international) and QEII-GSST
Note: these scholarships are only for Canadian students, there are a couple of scholarships for international students too; the grad administrator should reach out to you when there are scholarships that you’re eligible for
There are also internal scholarships within the department that you may be automatically applied for or can apply to

What is a supervisory committee and when/how do I form one?
Your supervisory committee consists of your supervisor(s) and two other faculty members in the department, you meet with them biannually. They are there to ensure you are making sufficient progress on your thesis and to help you deal with roadblocks you might be facing beyond just research
Timeline:
Declare your PhD supervisor at the start of your second year
Reach out to potential committee members and form your committee by December (your supervisor should help with this process)
First committee meeting in spring of your second year 
Thesis qualifying exam in summer of your second year
Biannual supervisory committee meetings start in fall of your 3rd year

How do grades work in grad school?
Courses have graded assignments, exams, and presentations (just like undergrad courses). Final grades are usually curved instead of corresponding directly to the grades you get on individual assignments, but this varies by course and instructor
Your grades don’t matter a whole lot - postdoc positions and jobs won’t ask about them. You need to remain in good academic standing, but your exact grades don’t matter nearly as much as they do in undergrad
In general, an A is good, an A- is fine, a B+ is ok, and a B means you struggled with the content
If you get multiple B’s in courses, the grad chair will probably reach out to you to have a chat about your progress in the program and discuss why you’re struggling
Committee meetings are also graded, and these are your only grades once you’re done with courses. They’re graded pretty similarly to courses
A’s and A-’s mean that you’re making good progress, potentially with some roadblocks along the way
B+ means you’ve hit some substantial roadblocks and need to work to get past them or fix some issues in your projects before your next meeting
B means you’re not making enough progress toward completion of your projects. If you get a B, your supervisor should discuss the implications with you and together you should come up with a plan to improve things by your next committee meeting
You want to avoid getting two B’s in a row 
Source: Kristen is revamping grades (he had a slide at the last faculty meeting with the new B+), perhaps this is written down somewhere?
