Note that this is a living document and we are working to get all the information pieces from our [information spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lk79MOAMsVst5baWwMix9EznET-9qKhkuPkSzbryl7Q/edit?usp=sharing) included here shortly.

## Information relevant for all

### How do I print?

1. Whether you print, photocopy or scan, you need your user codes. If you forget or do not have them, please contact Stipe to get yours. Each user has different codes for different purposes.
2.     Your codes can be used on either MP Ricoh or AB Ricoh unit.
3.     For printing, please follow the instruction on [DADDAA](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/internal/computing/printer-setup/) internal page
4.     If you are not connected to the wired network, when adding printer, your computer won’t be able to automatically discover the appropriate printer. In this case, you need to supply the IP for it: MP Ricoh (128.100.88.13), AB Ricoh (128.100.89.228).
### Room bookings

I need to book a room for a meeting/office hours, what do I do 

To book a room in AB (e.g. AB88), sign in to [the room booking calendar](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/internal/bookings-calendar/) and book from there. Contact Department management for the booking codes

To book a general room/lecture hall on campus, use the [LSM](https://lsm.utoronto.ca/webapp/f?p=220).




## Information relevant to Faculty 

### Housing & Relocation:

* Housing
  
The university offers [faculty housing](https://facultyhousing.utoronto.ca/new-faculty/application/).

You apply around Dec 1st and they will tell you the result in March-ish. It’s not guaranteed and it all depends on availability of what you asked (e.g 1 bedroom vs. 2 bedroom) vs what they have (i.e. someone is leaving the faculty housing). The rent is usually cheaper. It isn't always available, but they can also send along a list of real-estate agents and some websites for renting a place yourself. The GASA list is also useful (see below)

The rent in Toronto downtown area is in general expensive, e.g. have a bedroom a den near UofT (15 min walk) costs $2500 per month + $100 utility + $100 wifi per month. Living in the suburbs is probably cheape but also include commute.

* Relocation

You can contact the two moving company on the university’s list and they will send people to check your belongings and give you a quote. (You must do at least two quotes). Send the quotes to the department manager and they will approve one of them. The mover info (and other FAQ) can be found [online](https://www.facultyrelocation.utoronto.ca/planning-your-move/hire-mover/). 

- If moving from outside of Canada

You need to get a work permit -- You will get contacted by a lawyer for that from UofT. You will need to apply a Social Insurance Number (SIN) once you arrived at Canada. It takes about 2-3 weeks to receive. You give the number to the department manager so they will set up your payroll. You will be asked to enroll in the benefit program (e.g. insurance, pension) before your arrival.
You will create an Canadian bank account after arrival (see details on the relocation website)


### Teaching

How it works: in March/April, the undergraduate chair will send an email to faculty and ask you what course you want to teach and you send back your preference. There might be email back and forth, or schedule an appointment with the chair to have further discussion. And then the teaching for both Fall and Spring (of next year) will all be determined in April.

Tips: a few undergraduate courses are co-taught, e.g. AST325(am I right?), AST301, maybe more? Co-teaching is super helpful as your first time teaching! The university use Quercus and it is definitely helpful to have someone to ask and show you examples. Also, having someone to help you when your student ask for special accommodations/request. 

Tips: the department has a lot of undergraduate students and courses so it is likely you are going to teach undergraduate courses. Teaching a graduate course is good way to get graduate student. 

Another thing at UofT is mini-courses for graduate student. So you prepare something for 6-weeks instead of 12-weeks (the regular one), and you can propose a talk you are interested in (could be anything) and gauge the interest. If there are enough interest (>5 student?) then you can open it. That might be a good thing to try if you want to get graduate students but do not want to teach a graduate course (I personally never tried though).

### Grants & Awards

The Faculty A&S has a great grant writing supporting team. For example, [Monica Caverson](<mailto:monica.caverson@utoronto.ca>) can give you some information on who can help read/edit your grants. You probably want to send her an email asap (even before you start at UofT, especially if you are applying for NSERC grants before you start.)
After contacting the FAS team, they willl usually will set up a timeline with you and ask you to send them the first draft by certain date. 

They will also give you a detailed timeline/instruction for when to submit to the university. The team will read the proposal, make edits and send revision with suggestions. 

EDI resources: Almost all the proposal requires you to write some EDI statement or plan, and the [NSERC page](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/InterAgency-Interorganismes/EDI-EDI/index_eng.asp) is useful.

Even though sometime you are applying for some awards that requires statement/proposal, you could still ask them to read for you and the team is professional and have a super quick turn around (usually within 1-2 days for short ones and 3-4 day for long ones). So do not hesitate to contact Monica and the FAS team if you need any guidance.

There is no overhead when you apply to an external grant! (something like 50% in US). You will have an account set on [Employee Self-Service (ESS) for grant management](https://easi.its.utoronto.ca/administrative-management-systems/employee-self-service-ess/). You should be able to see the details of your account details under “My Research” → My Research On Line → Account. If it says you have no permission, then you ask the department manager to help you that.

* What grants to apply for new faculty:

- NSERC Disvoery Grant (DG). This is something you need to apply for other NSERC grant, so try to get it even it is not a lot of money (20-40k/year for new faculty). For DG, you need to submit an Letter of Notice at the beginning of August to be eligible for the application due in the fall. The money will come in April of next year if you are awarded. So as long as you are a faculty by next April, you can apply this round. C
- Connaught Fund New Research -- internal UofT grant, 20k. Not a lot the application is not very long (and you can reuse some of your NSERC DG proposal.
-  Ontario Early Researcher Awards -- 150k including matching from the department (NOI due September 23, 2023). This funding requires that you already have Tri-council (e.g. NSERC) funding. Details [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/early-researcher-awards)
-  CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar Program -- 100k. It has many disciplines. Some of astronomy faculty should be eligible for [Gravity & the Extreme Universe](https://cifar.ca/research-programs/gravity-extreme-universe/)
- To be added: Internal funding opportunities (from DAA or Dunlap)
  
Apart from these grants, there are also a lot of awards for junior faculty. Usually the Award Committee chair (Scott Tremaine right now) will send out the list every few months. You look at it and see what you are eligible for. You can contact Scott (or Bob/Bryan) to nominate you. Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Do not be shy to ask them to nominate you! They department want you to get award (it’s good for the department) so they will try their best to support you.


### Graduate students:
If a student does not have a Masters before joining UofT, then they will take AST1501 and AST1500, during which they will work with a faculty for a project. You do not need to pay the student for this. The department pays the 1st year of a graduate student stiped, before they have selected their advisor.

The cost of a graduate student is split between the department and advisor (and the student gets additional pay for TA duties). Check faculty guidelines or speak to the Graduate Secretary for most up-to-date rates.
Importantly, you can buy your student our of TA duties if you have funds or need them full time on a project.

Dunlap covers the publication cost for papers that the students are leading. See details [here](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/academics/graduate-studies/current/funding/publication-award/). 

Dunlap and also the Reinhard fund covers some travel for the students. See details the [training grant for students](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/academics/graduate-studies/current/funding/dunlap-training-grant/)



### Hiring undergraduate students

* **Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)**. 
  
  The SURP program is organised and run by the SURP committee. It runs from the first week of May through the third week of August each year. In addition to pursuing research, undergraduate students in SURP attend various events that often include a first week computing course, seminars and workshops on various topics, and student presentations.  
  
  Requests for potential summer project descriptions are sent by the committee, typically in late fall.  Student applications are solicited through the SURP webpages, with an application deadline in late January or early February. Student application packages are shared with SURP supervisors, with selection and employment offers timelines in late February - early March. 
  Funding requirements for the supervisor vary depending on student selection for NSERC awards, faculty position, etc. 

* **Work study**
  
  U of T runs a work study program to hire undergraduates over the Fall/Winter and Summer semesters. Students must be enrolled in courses over the work study period.  Project descriptions are solicited in June for Fall/Winter semesters, and in Feb/March for Summer semesters. The application is open, so this program is not suited to hiring a specific student. Selected projects receive funding for 70% of the student pay, with the supervisor contributing the rest. 
  
  More information on project descriptions and deadlines can be found on the [work study page](https://clnx.utoronto.ca/staff-faculty/wspublic.htm).
* **AST 423/430**
  
  Some undergraduate will want to work with you via AST 430: supervised study. You will need to prepare a Syllabus (very brief) and a grading scheme (since you will need give the student a grade at the end)
  If a student is working with you through a course, you do not need to pay. But you should design the project to train their research skill rather than taking them as free labor.  
  UofT has a lot of undergraduates majoring in astronomy (~60 per year?) roughly half of them will need to do 4th year thesis project through AST 425 and so in Sept you might be reached by a lot of undergrad looking for projects. It’s a great opportunity to get undergraduates in this way. But be prepared that most of them have no research experience.
* **Casual employment**
  
  Some students may want to work with you without taking a course, as a casual worker. The rate will be determined by the HR after you submit a list of job duties - but this can be very expensive. There are often issues with unionisation or visa requirements etc. You can specify the number of hours you want them to work per week. Contact Department Admin or the faculty slack channel if you have specific questions. 

* **Can I take undergrads as voluntary interns (i.e. unpaid)?**
  The answer is yes only if it is a training to benefit the student and not benefit your research. The interns cannot be doing work or providing a service to the employer (i.e. cannot be doing anything to contribute to/advance the PIs research projects). Also, you need to ask the intern to sign a form and send to the department manager.


## Information relevant for Postdocs

### Stipend payments
Each September, you will get an offer letter from the graduate administrator that breaks down your funding sources and lists your final salary for the year
The grant money is paid in three instalments in September, January, and May, and you get TA salary payments at the end of each month you TA
Each instalment of your grant money may come in multiple separate pieces because the funding comes from different sources (the department, your supervisor, external scholarships, etc). These portions can arrive in your bank account weeks apart from each other!
Your TA money and supervisor funded portion of your stipend are paid through the employment system, while the portions that come from the department and A&S are paid through ACORN.

Set up direct deposit in both systems to get your money more quickly. Gautam will reach out about setting up your employee portal, and you can enter direct deposit info in ACORN directly. 

Since you aren’t paid regularly, it’s helpful to write out a yearly budget. Use your yearly salary from your September offer letter and divide that by 12 to get your monthly income, and use that to help you stick to a budget.

### How much vacation time can I take?
3 weeks (15 working days) each academic year (September 1st - August 31st). This refreshes every year, does not accrue from year to year. Scheduled holidays and winter break do not count towards these three weeks.

There is no formal way to set vacation dates, usually just inform your supervisor.

### Which scholarships can I apply to and when?
There are generally two major deadlines for domestic applicants a year for applying to funding, some smaller ones may pop up throughout the year as well

* In september: NSERC and Vanier
* In May: OGS (+ OGS international) and QEII-GSST

Note: these scholarships are only for Canadian students, there are a couple of scholarships for international students too; the grad administrator should reach out to you when there are scholarships that you’re eligible for

There are also internal scholarships within the department that you may be automatically applied for or can apply to

### What is a supervisory committee and when/how do I form one?

Your supervisory committee consists of your supervisor(s) and two other faculty members in the department, you meet with them biannually. They are there to ensure you are making sufficient progress on your thesis and to help you deal with roadblocks you might be facing beyond just research

**Timeline:**
- Declare your PhD supervisor at the start of your second year
- Reach out to potential committee members and form your committee by December (your supervisor should help with this process)
- First committee meeting in spring of your second year 
- Thesis qualifying exam in summer of your second year
- Biannual supervisory committee meetings start in fall of your 3rd year

### How do grades work in grad school?
Courses have graded assignments, exams, and presentations (just like undergrad courses). Final grades are usually curved instead of corresponding directly to the grades you get on individual assignments, but this varies by course and instructor

Your grades don’t matter a whole lot - postdoc positions and jobs won’t ask about them. You need to remain in good academic standing, but your exact grades don’t matter nearly as much as they do in undergrad

In general, an A is good, an A- is fine, a B+ is ok, and a B means you struggled with the content. If you get multiple B’s in courses, the grad chair will probably reach out to you to have a chat about your progress in the program and discuss why you’re struggling.

Committee meetings are also graded, and these are your only grades once you’re done with courses. They’re graded pretty similarly to courses in that A’s and A-’s mean that you’re making good progress, potentially with some roadblocks along the way. B+ means you’ve hit some substantial roadblocks and need to work to get past them or fix some issues in your projects before your next meeting. B means you’re not making enough progress toward completion of your projects. If you get a B, your supervisor should discuss the implications with you and together you should come up with a plan to improve things by your next committee meeting. Getting two B's in a row can mean you have to leave grad school.

### How do I apply for a postdoc?
The postdoctoral application process runs from mid September to late March/mid April. Postdoctoral positions are typically advertised online in places like the [AAS Job Register](https://jobregister.aas.org/) and/or [Academic Jobs Online](https://academicjobsonline.org/).

Applications typically consist of a cover letter, a CV/resume and a research statement. This statement should summarize your past research and describe the new directions of research to plan to undertake in the future. Some postdoctoral positions are to work on a specific project. If that is the case, then your research statement s*hould discuss how you would work in that area*, so it is clear to the people reading the application that you are a good fit for the position. Prize postdoc applications present a more self-defined research plan (see below). Postdoctoral positions require three letters of reference. It is a good rule of thumb to keep an idea of who your letter writers are, and to make sure to diversify your research to include more than just your supervisor, so that when the time comes to write a letter you have three people who can write one for you. 

When asking for letters of reference, give your letter writers plenty of advance warning, and then give them repeated reminders as the due dates approach. Do not hesitate to remind them (it is easy to get swamped in deadlines if you are writing letters for more than a few people in any job season). 

### How do I get a prize postdoc?
Prize (or independent) postdocs are ones in which you have the research freedom to work on projects that you define, as opposed to working on a topic with a professor who advertises a specific job/focus. There is more academic freedom in a Prize postdoc, but as a result the application for prize postdocs can be more involved and the competition can be fierce. 

Applications rest on both your academic history/track record and your research statement. The research statement must include your proposed independent research ideas and plan (and not just a focus on previous work). The statement should not only talk about your skills or experience, but clearly articulate why the proposed research is novel and timely.
The academic history/track record relies largely on publications. In order to be competitive for prize fellowships, first author publications are key. There is a review of the statistics on publication numbers for prize postdoctoral positions (and other factors, including number of years since graduation) is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09505.pdf) It is worth bearing in mind that there is a ton of great research you can do in a postdoc that is targeted too, so while the publication numbers typical of those who win prize fellowships can be daunting, they are not the only stats of all those who have won a postdoctoral position.
